title: Architecture Framework Alignment Grid
---

The ISE’s Architecture Framework Alignment Grid (“the alignment grid”) details alignment of the Project Interoperability to reference architecture frameworks to achieve operational capabilities. The Architecture Framework Alignment Grid was developed to ensure interoperability alignment and inclusion in current architecture reference models and frameworks. This grid aligns each of the Common Approach (CA) domains (Business, Data, Applications and Systems, Infrastructure, Security, and Performance) with interoperability requirements, the ISE artifact (which provides a description of how it addresses the interoperability requirements), and the corresponding architecture artifact from each of the commonly accepted architecture frameworks (FEAF, DoDAF, TOGAF, GRA, and IC PAG).

The alignment grid is designed to aid an implementer in the generation of the necessary architecture products based on the architecture framework required. The grid is sub-divided by the CA domains described above. The grid column definitions are:

* Column 1 – **ISE Minimum Requirements for Interoperability:** A description of the requirements in each of the domains needed to be interoperable.
* Column 2 – **ISE Artifact Description:** Provides instructions and recommendations on how to demonstrate interoperability based on the associated ISE I2F requirement and using the selected frameworks on the right of the chart on the next page.
* Columns 3-7 – **Applicable Architectural Artifacts:** Based on which architectural framework (FEAF, DoDAF, GRA, ICEA PAG, or TOGAF) is utilized, the artifacts for each framework are listed that address both the ISE requirements and ISE artifact description in the left columns of the chart on the next page.

The alignment grid is meant to address the gaps between business and technical stakeholders, providing architecture development guidance, artifact identification, and implementation support. It describes the minimum set of reference architectural artifacts necessary to demonstrate interoperability. The grid is also designed to aid an implementer in the generation of the necessary architecture products based on the architecture framework required.
 
For the Architecture Alignment and Implementation Process:

1.	Review and identify mission- and business-specific enterprise reference architecture (i.e., Common Approach) domain needs. (Column 1)
2.	Once mission and business needs are identified, review the minimum requirements for interoperability (e.g., what needs to be satisfied for your mission/business to be interoperable?). (Coordinate Columns 1 and 2)
3.	Coordinate with interoperability artifact descriptions. (Identify descriptions in Column 3 that satisfy interoperability needs identified in Columns 1 and 2.)
4.	Once interoperability needs are identified, align with applicable architecture artifact for methodology used at your department, agency, or business. (Select representative architectural reference model in Column 4; identify artifacts relevant to interoperability and information sharing.)
5.	Ensure identified applicable architecture artifact is included in your reference, segment, and solution architecture methodology.

*NOTE: Only one architecture framework (e.g., FEAF, DoDAF, GRA, IC PAG, or TOGAF) should be selected when developing the required architecture artifacts based on the organization. Also, please see Reference Architecture Template, which includes detailed information on what to include when building or updating a reference architecture using the Project Interoperability concepts for interoperability.*
