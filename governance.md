This is an online collection of frameworks, best practices, guidelines, and case studies developed to help agencies share information responsibly. Project Interoperability will evolve over time as a community resource to facilitate adoption of interoperability. To facilitate collaboration across the government and the private sector, the Project Interoperability is published on the developer social network GitHub.

The [office of the Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment](www.ise.gov) is dedicated to maximizing openness, participation, and collaboration while ensuring the integrity of the resources hosted within Project Interoperability. This page provides information on ways to participate in improving and advancing the Information Interoperability Project and how we will govern it.

### Contributing

This is a collaborative, open source project. Federal employees and members of the general public are strongly encouraged to improve the project by contributing. Fortunately, contributing is very easy. Simply log into GitHub, click the “Improve this content” button at the top of every page, make your edit, and hit “submit.” Your changes will appear once they are approved by a Subject Matter Expert. You can also [send us an email](mailto:outreach@ise.gov) with your suggested edits.

Please indicate if you would like credit for your suggestion, or we will assume you would like the suggestion to remain anonymous. We will then post the suggestion to the issue tracker tool and adjudicate it on the same timeline that we adjudicate all other contributions.

Ultimately, the goal is for users to contribute to the project by suggesting changes to code/content (making “pull requests”). However, there are many ways to participate:

* **Browse.** Look around at the different resources available.
* **Clone.** Copy code/content to your local machine. There is no official record in GitHub, and others cannot see what you do with the code/content.
* **Fork.** Copy code/content to your own repo in GitHub, and make modifications there. Record of the fork is seen in Project Interoperability on GitHub, and others can see the code/content, but it now resides outsides the Project.
* **Comment.** Comment on the code/content in the Project Interoperability using the issue tracker function. Others can see your suggested changes in a public log on  Information Interoperability Project. A moderator must accept, modify, or reject the comment in that public log.
* **Contribute.** Suggest changes to the code/content in  Project Interoperability by making a pull request. Others can see your suggested changes in a public log. A moderator must accept, modify, or reject the suggested change in that public log before it becomes a part of the official code/content.

### Ownership
Project Interoperability is managed by the office of the [Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment](www.ise.gov) with advice and recommendations from the [Standards Coordinating Council](www.ise.gov/standards-coordinating-council).  

### Approving Changes
Using GitHub terminology, the Project Interoperability is a collection of different little-p “projects” housed in individual repositories, or “repos.” Each individual project repo will be managed as an open source project. In other words, users can make pull requests (suggest changes). A repo manager will adjudicate the pull requests (accept, modify, or reject) in a public log on a standard release cycle. Proposed changes to relevant policy areas will be evaluated by relevant policy officials. Information on the repo manager and release cycle for updates will be available in each repo’s documentation file. Different ISE mission partners may be delegated management of individual technical repos, as well as provide daily technical oversight and user support for the Project. Given that the breadth of the Information Interoperability Project supports both technical and policy work, there will be different governance processes for each subject.

* **Technical Repositories Governance & Review Cycle** (e.g., source code, applications, best practices)– Technical repositories will be maintained by staff within the office of the Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment. All comments and proposed changes will be reviewed regularly, at least on bi-weekly intervals. Additional stakeholders will be involved in review processes based on needed subject matter expertise. 
* **Policy Related Repositories Governance & Release Cycle** (e.g., open licensing, metadata)— Changes to repositories with implications for the policy may require approval from the [White House Information Sharing and Access Interagency Policy Committee](www.ise.gov/gov) or its Information Interoperability Subcommittee. These organizations meet regularly and will review proposed changes. Additional federal stakeholders may be involved in review processes based on needed subject matter expertise.
