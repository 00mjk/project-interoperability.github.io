# Project Interoperability

IMPORTANT: THIS IS A DRAFT. LARGE PARTS OF THIS PROJECT ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND MAY REFER BACK TO PROJECT OPEN DATA THROUGHOUT THE MONTH OF MARCH.

## Problem this Solves

Our government needs to share information better, faster, and smarter. Our mission is to improve the government's ability to share the right information, with the right people, at the right time.

## How this Project Solves this Problem

The goal of Project Interoperability is to help government and non-government organizations identify a baseline of terms, tools, and techniques to connect networks and systems.  We aim to be architecture-agnostic, and we are trying to normalize the way information sharing technology is developed. We want to achieve a connected government.

This project is based on [Project Open Data](http://project-open-data.github.io). Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

## Where You Come In

Project Interoperability can be used to access, improve, and use information sharing tools and resources. It uses some of the existing, well known [enterprise architecture frameworks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_architecture_framework) ([TOGAF](http://www.opengroup.org/togaf/), [DoDAF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defense_Architecture_Framework), [FEAF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_enterprise_architecture), etc.), and the principles of service-oriented architecture (such as reuse and intrinsic interoperability) to suggest standards, tools, and methodologies to link existing systems. It also specifies the development of common documents and products that will enable disparate departments’ and agencies’ architectures to make the full framework operational.  
Project Interoperability can be utilized differently depending on the role you have in your organization. Some examples include:

* Program manager or procurement officer: Project Interoperability provides suggestions on what you need to have an interoperable system. It gives a program manager the language they need to describe what they want to aid in more cost-effective and smoother procurement.
* Private industry: Project Interoperability provides a common language to help industry respond to RFIs and hold conversations with federal customers about their needs. 
* Architect: When setting up models, schemas, and deciding what standards to apply, Project Interoperability guides decision making around architecture details.
