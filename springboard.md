[Springboard](http://www.ijis.org/_programs/springboard.html) is an evaluation and certification program designed to help advance information sharing in the justice, public safety, and homeland security communities. Industry and government can use Springboard to test whether or not their programs are complaint with information sharing standards. The conformance criteria are developed to match a standards‚Äêbased interoperability specification. The [Prescription Drug Monitoring Information Exchange (PMIX)](http://www.ijis.org/_programs/pdmp.html) was one of the first programs to use Springboard to test conformance to standards.
