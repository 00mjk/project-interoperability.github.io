title: Applications/Services Domain Reference Architecture Template
---

**Alignment with Project Interoperability Toolsand Resources:** Operational Capabilities, Technical Standards, Technical Capabilities, Exchange Patterns, Exchange Specifications.

**Overview:** Describe the technical services supporting the common activities used for discovering, identifying, distributing, protecting, and managing the data/ information needed by external users. Provide any applicable service standards, application architecture approaches such as SOA, or other information required to interact with the applications/service within the domain.

**Objective of the Architecture:** Capture the specifications and functional requirements of the applications/service to the level necessary for external application developers can interface with application/services available to externals.

Application/Service Environment Considerations:

* Identify services and common activities, their service component and the interfaces/ interconnections between the services and data assets that are exchanged. (A1)

* Describe recommended and/or possible implementation approaches (e.g., Cloud, SOA, Mobile) and considerations for approaches to be captured in applicable artifacts.

* Provide standards and/or standards requirements for consideration by the reference architecture. These need not be prescriptive but suggestive and currently utilized within the application class. (A6)

* Describe extensibility approaches for future users/applications in any modernization plan artifacts.

* Describe how the application architecture scales for more users in any modernization plan artifacts.

Application/Service Requirements/Constraints:

* Specify the standards/specifications used by the services to make them discoverable.

* Describe the functions performed by the applications/services and any constraints on the data used and the flow of the data. (A3)

* Describe the data assets used by the applications/services and how the data is exchanged between the services. (A2)

* Describe the data flows being exchanged between services and the attributes of the exchanges. (A4)

* Specify any service standards used by or required by the applications/services. (A6)

* Specify how the "service-level agreements" are enforced (manually or machine-level) and the standard/specification if machine-level. (A6)

Application/Service Provider and User Roles and Responsibilities:

* Specify the provider and user roles and responsibilities with respect to application/service lifecycle (Development – O&M – Retirement). (B4)

* Specify rules/laws with respect to products/data/information generated by the applications/services. (A5)

API Considerations:

* APIs published/exposed so that future users can access and create applications with the information/data, describe how the developers access the APIs. (A6)

Cloud Application/Service Implementation Considerations:

* Describe 'continuity of operations' considerations for information/data flows. (A3)

Mobile Application/Service Implementation Considerations:

* Describe mobile implementation considerations that are unique to the mobile architecture environment in addition to service identification. 

*Key Focus Area: Applications/Services - Describe the applications/services and their interconnections between other services as well as the data assets and the information flows that are being used and exchanged. Applications/service and their external interfaces should be standardized when possible for scalability and interoperability purposes. Specify the service standards used and their applicability both internally, externally and reusability.*
