## ISE Common Profile Framework Description

The ISE Common Profile Framework Description, which we'll refer to as the Common Profile, provides a structured but modular approach in describing a component to promote reuse, standardization, and interoperability across various subject areas and organizations. Simply put, a common profile is a set of instructions that describes how to achieve a desired outcome. Similarly, the Common Profile supports the mission and business needs across government organizations by identifying a base set of elements, specifications, and/or standards so that these organizations can become interoperable through sharing services and information resources. This is accomplished through documenting the mission/business requirements along with the supporting capabilities and the enabling technical modular components. For example, a community of interest made up of six organizations decides to implement a _Common Desktop Gateway_ (business need) to foster employee mobility and cost avoidance across the community. It would be inefficient and challenging if each organization decided only to implement operational and technical components required in support of the business need internal to its organization, thereby achieving no interoperability or cost avoidance. A Common Profile helps avoid this siloed approach by leveraging a common methodology for referencing standards and specifications across multiple organizations. So, a profile for the _Common Desktop Gateway_ would be developed with the consensus of all six organizations where the operational and technical components can interoperate to provide the users 'same look and feel,' as well access to desired services across the community networks.
