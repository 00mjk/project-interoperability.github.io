IMPORTANT: THIS IS A DRAFT. LARGE PARTS OF THIS PROJECT ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND MAY REFER BACK TO PROJECT OPEN DATA THROUGHOUT THE MONTH OF MARCH.

##1. Background

Project Interoperability is a start-up guide for information interoperability.  The tools and resources presented here are in different levels of maturity, and some of them are even still drafts. They are made available here as a resource for improving information interoperability in and outside of government.

Information interoperability is the ability to transfer and use information in a consistent, efficient way across multiple organizations and IT systems.  From a technical perspective, interoperability is developed through the consistent application of design principles and design standards to address a specific mission problem.

Information interoperability is important because it increases timely, responsible information sharing, can reduce costs and redundancy, and use best practices. These are all things that enhance decision making for government leaders, industry, and citizens.

We hope you help us improve and adopt this as a resource to build information interoperability throught the Information Sharing Environment. Learn more about:

##2. Interoperability Tools

These are the top most important tools for building information interoperability. Learn more in an overview about [how you can use these tools](http://ise.gov).

2-1 [Common Profile] - This is the common profile.

2-2 [Springboard](/springboard/) - A sentence about Springboard.

2-3 [Architecture Alignment] - More I3F tools.

2-4 [Maturity Model] - More I3F tools.

2-5 [Reference Architecture Template] - More I3F tools.

2-6 [Geospatial Interoperability] - More I3F tools.

2-7 [Attribute Exchange](/attribute-exchange/) - A sentence about attribute exchange.

2-8 [Identity and Access Management](/idam/) - A sentence about IdAM.

2-9 [Exchange Patterns] - More I3F tools.

2-10 [National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)](/niem/) - A sentence about NIEM.

2-11 [ISE Information Interoperability Framework (I3F)] - We have broken out the most useful tools and guidance of the Information Interoperability Framework, or I3F. We want to collaborate with you, our stakeholders and partners, to edit and improve it. You can also download the I3F PDF(coming soon), in its most recent version, V0.5. The content in this project may differ from the PDF because it is a work in progress only based on the I2F PDF.

2-12 [ISE Standards Specifications Framework](/standards-specifications/) - A sentence about standards specifications.
