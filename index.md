##1. Background

IMPORTANT: THIS IS A DRAFT. LARGE PARTS OF THIS PROJECT ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND MAY REFER BACK TO PROJECT OPEN DATA THROUGHOUT THE MONTH OF MARCH.

This is a set-up guide for information interoperability.

Information interoperability is the ability to transfer and use information in a consistent, efficient way across multiple organizations and IT systems. From a technical perspective, interoperability is fostered through the consistent application of design principles and design standards to address a specific mission problem. 

Information interoperability is important because it increases timely information sharing, can reduce costs and redundancy, and reveal best practices in government. This improves decisionmaking for government leaders.

The goal of Project Interoperability is to help government and non-government organizations identify a baseline of terms, tools and techniques to create an information sharing network in agnostic terms and for any type of information sharing. We are trying to normalize the way information sharing technology is developed. We want to achieve a connected government.

We hope you help us improve and adopt this as a resource to build information interoperability throught the Information Sharing Environment. Learn more about us at [ISE.gov](http://ise.gov).

##3. ISE Information Interoperability Framework (I3F) Tools

We have broken out the most useful tools and guidance of the Information Interoperability Framework, or I3F. We want to collaborate with you, our stakeholders and partners, to edit and improve it. You can also [download the I2F PDF](http://ise.gov), as it was approved by the ISA IPC on (date). The content in this project may differ from the PDF because it is a work in progress only based on the I2F PDF.

##4. Use Cases

Use cases of novel or best practices from agencies who are leading in open data help others understand the challenges and opportunities for success.

(Use cases should illustrate best practice applications of interoperability tools to support mission outcomes. For example, the statewide ISEs are using exchange patterns to enable data set exchange and usage. This means that a local law enforcement agency can easily broadcast an Amber Alert message not only to police officers on the street but also to the general public, relevant federal agencies, and local businesses. The format should be an actor did something to accomplish a goal.)

6-1 [Department of Labor API Program](labor-case-study/) - A department perspective on developing APIs for general use and, in particular, building the case for an ecosystem of users by developing SDKs.

6-2 [Department of Transportation Enterprise Data Inventory](transportation-case-study/) - A review of DOT's strategy and policy when creating a robust data inventory program.  

6-3 [Disaster Assistance Program Coordination](fema-case-study/) - The coordinated campaign led by FEMA has integrated a successful data exchange among 16 agencies to coordinate an important public service.  

6-4 [Environmental Protection Agency Central Data Exchange](epa-case-study/) - The agency's data exchange provides a model for programs that seek to coordinate the flow of data among industry, state, local, and tribal entities.  

6-5 [FederalRegister.gov API](https://www.federalregister.gov/uploads/2012/11/FR2-API-Case-Study1.pdf) - A core government program update that has grown into an important public service.

6-6 [National Broadband Map](http://www.scribd.com/doc/109998799/The-National-Broadband-Map-A-Case-Study-on-Open-Innovation-for-National-Policy) - The National Broadband Map, a case study on open innovation for national policy.  Produced by the [Wilson Center](http://www.wilsoncenter.org/).

6-7 [National Renewable Energy Laboratory API program](http://developer.nrel.gov/api-case-study/) - An agency perspective on developing APIs for general use and in particular building the case for the internal re-use of the resources.

6-8 [USAID Crowdsourcing to Open Data](http://transition.usaid.gov/our_work/economic_growth_and_trade/development_credit/pdfs/2012/USAIDCrowdsourcingCaseStudy.pdf) - A case study that shows how USAID invited the "crowd" to clean and geocode a USAID dataset in order to open and map the data.
