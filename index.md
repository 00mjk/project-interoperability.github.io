IMPORTANT: THIS IS A DRAFT AND STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

##1. Background

Project Interoperability is a start-up guide for information interoperability.  The tools and resources presented here are in different levels of maturity, and some of them are even still drafts. They are made available here as a resource for improving information interoperability in and outside of government.

Information interoperability is the ability to transfer and use information in a consistent, efficient way across multiple organizations and IT systems.  From a technical perspective, interoperability is developed through the consistent application of design principles and design standards to address a specific mission problem.

Information interoperability is important because it increases timely, responsible information sharing, can reduce costs and redundancy, and use best practices. These are all things that enhance decision making for government leaders, industry, and citizens.

We hope you help us improve and adopt this as a resource to build information interoperability throught the Information Sharing Environment. Learn more about:

##2. Interoperability Tools

These are the top tools for building information interoperability.

2-1 [Common Profile] describes high-level details associated with any program or system (such as the interoperability profile or metadata). 

2-2 [Springboard](/springboard/) is an evaluation and certification program designed to help industry and government programs ensure complaince with information sharing standards. 

2-3 [Architecture Alignment] refers to the process required to create interoperability between different architectures. For example, an architecture alignment would be required for a DoDAF system to “talk to” a TOGAF system.  

2-4 [Maturity Model] is an approach for describing the various stages of implementation of any system or program. The five stages, in order from least mature to most mature, are: ad hoc, repeatable, enhanced, managed, and optimized.

2-5 [Reference Architecture Template] is a data-agnostic template for an architecture, which provides a common vocabulary for implementation

2-6 [Geospatial Interoperable Reference Architecture (GIRA)](http://www.ise.gov/blog/michael-howell/our-approach-geospatial-interoperability) is a framework for developing new geospatial system investments and aligning existing geospatial capabilities. The GIRA is in development, and will be available late summer 2014.

2-7 [Attribute Exchange](/attribute-exchange/) - 

2-8 [Identity and Access Management](/idam/) is a diverse portfolio of services and processes that provides identity management, authentication, and authorization. 

2-9 [Exchange Patterns](/exchange-patterns/) provide generic solutions to help demonstrate a commonly occurring need for exchange of data or information between two or more partners. 

2-10 [National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)](/niem/) is a community-driven, government-wide, standards-based approach to exchanging information. 

2-11 [ISE Information Interoperability Framework (I2F)] - 

2-12 [ISE Standards Specifications Framework](/standards-specifications/) describes interoperable information exchange attributes beginning with standardized requirements and definitions. It includes the descriptive mechanics to develop components, and processes necessary to identify and normalize standards to achieve interoperability.

##3. Use Cases

Use cases of novel or best practices from agencies who are leading in open data help others understand the challenges and opportunities for success.
